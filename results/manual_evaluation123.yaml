  feedback: '**Score**: 85

    **Explanation**: The actual response is quite detailed and provides a comprehensive
    overview of the laptop''s features. It goes beyond the expected output by providing
    additional information such as the specific processor model, the type of display,
    the battery capacity, the Bluetooth version, the number and types of ports, and
    the operating system. This could be beneficial for potential buyers who want more
    detailed specifications. However, the response does not directly address the "power
    of portability" as mentioned in the expected output, and it does not mention the
    laptop''s suitability for working on the go. Additionally, the response includes
    a placeholder for the estimated battery life, which should have been filled in.
    The response is also significantly longer than the expected output, which may
    not be ideal for all contexts. Overall, the response is informative and well-written,
    but it deviates from the expected output in a few key areas.'
