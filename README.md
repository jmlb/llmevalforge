a) Contextual Understanding: Test the model's ability to understand and use context from previous interactions or given background information.


Certainly. To test the model's contextual understanding, we'll create a series of interconnected prompts that build upon each other. This will assess the model's ability to retain and use information from previous interactions. Here's an implementation for this type of test:
Contextual Understanding Test ImplementationClick to open code
This implementation includes:

A function run_contextual_test that takes the student model, teacher model, and a test set as inputs.
It iterates through the test set, maintaining a conversation history.
For each test, it provides the full conversation history to the student model, ensuring it has access to all previous context.
The teacher model evaluates the student's response based on its relevance and use of context.
Results are collected and saved.

To use this implementation, you'll need to create a contextual_test_set.yaml file. Here's an example of what that might look like:
Contextual Test Set ExampleClick to open text
This test set creates a conversation that builds upon itself, requiring the model to remember and use information from previous interactions. It covers different aspects of a trip to Paris, focusing on art and transportation, which relates back to the earlier discussion about attractions.
To integrate this into your existing evaluation framework:

Add the run_contextual_test function to your eval.py file or create a new file for it.
Create the contextual_test_set.yaml file with your specific tests.
Add a section in your main evaluation script to run this contextual test.

This implementation will allow you to assess the model's ability to understand and use context from previous interactions, providing a more comprehensive evaluation of its capabilities.

Certainly. I'll provide an implementation for testing a model's fact-checking and source verification capabilities. This implementation will include additions to your dataset and evaluation process.
First, let's add some examples to your dataset:

Now, let's modify the evaluation process to include these new examples. We'll need to update the configs.yaml file to include instructions for fact-checking tasks:
Updated configs.yamlClick to open code
Finally, let's update the eval.py script to include a specific evaluation metric for fact-checking tasks:
Updated eval.pyClick to open code
This implementation adds fact-checking and source verification tests to your evaluation process. Here's a summary of the changes:

We've added new examples to the dataset that specifically test fact-checking abilities.
The configs.yaml file has been updated to include instructions for fact-checking tasks in both the student and teacher model prompts.
The eval.py script has been modified to include a new evaluate_fact_checking function that assesses specific aspects of fact-checking responses.
The main evaluation loop now applies this additional evaluation for fact-checking tasks and combines it with the general evaluation.

To use this implementation:

Add the new examples to your custom_testset.yaml file.
Update your configs.yaml file with the new prompts.
Replace your eval.py file with the updated version.

This setup will now test the model's ability to distinguish between facts and opinions, suggest reliable sources for verification, and identify potential misinformation. The evaluation results will reflect these additional capabilities, providing a more comprehensive assessment of the model's fact-checking and source verification skills.

Certainly. I'll provide an implementation to test the consistency of the model's responses across similar questions asked in different ways. This will involve adding new examples to the dataset, updating the configuration, and modifying the evaluation script.
First, let's add some examples to the dataset:

Now, let's update the configs.yaml file to include instructions for consistency testing:
Updated configs.yamlClick to open code
Finally, let's update the eval.py script to include a specific evaluation metric for consistency tests:
Updated eval.pyClick to open code
This implementation adds consistency testing to your evaluation process. Here's a summary of the changes:

We've added new examples to the dataset that specifically test consistency. These examples are grouped using a group_id field.
The configs.yaml file has been updated to include instructions for consistency testing in both the student and teacher model prompts.
The eval.py script has been modified to include new functions:

evaluate_consistency: Evaluates the consistency of responses within a group.
calculate_similarity: A simple method to calculate the similarity between two responses.


The main evaluation loop now stores responses for grouped questions and evaluates consistency after all responses have been collected.

To use this implementation:

Add the new examples to your custom_testset.yaml file.
Update your configs.yaml file with the new prompts.
Replace your eval.py file with the updated version.

This setup will now test the model's ability to provide consistent answers across different phrasings of similar questions. The evaluation results will reflect this additional capability, providing a more comprehensive assessment of the model's consistency.
Note that the calculate_similarity function provided here is a simple implementation based on word overlap. For more sophisticated consistency evaluation, you might want to consider using more advanced natural language processing techniques, such as semantic similarity measures or embedding-based comparisons.
To visualize the consistency scores, you can update your generate_plots function to include a new plot specifically for consistency scores. This could be a bar chart showing the consistency score for each group of related questions.

Context Retention:
Evaluate how well the model retains and uses information from earlier parts of a conversation in later responses.

Certainly! There are several additional evaluation tests we could conduct to provide a more comprehensive assessment of the model's capabilities. Here are some ideas:

Multilingual Proficiency:
Test the model's ability to understand and generate responses in multiple languages, including translation tasks.
Context Retention:
Evaluate how well the model retains and uses information from earlier parts of a conversation in later responses.
Abstraction and Generalization:
Test the model's ability to apply learned concepts to new, unseen scenarios.
Emotional Intelligence:
Assess the model's capability to recognize and respond appropriately to emotional cues in text.
Code Generation and Debugging:
Evaluate the model's proficiency in writing, understanding, and debugging code in various programming languages.
Multimodal Understanding:
If the model supports it, test its ability to understand and reason about information from multiple modalities (text, images, etc.).
Adversarial Robustness:
Test the model's performance when faced with adversarial inputs designed to trick or confuse it.
Bias Detection and Mitigation:
Evaluate the model's tendency to produce biased responses and its ability to recognize and mitigate bias when instructed.
Task Adaptation:
Assess how quickly and effectively the model can adapt to new tasks with minimal instruction or examples.
Long-term Dependency Handling:
Test the model's ability to maintain coherence and accuracy in very long contexts or conversations.

Let's implement one of these: the Context Retention test. This will evaluate how well the model remembers and uses information from earlier in a conversation.
