# LLMEvalForge

# Model Evaluation Framework

**LLMEvalForge** is a Python framework designed to automate the evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs) in custom domains. It enables the creation of tailored test suites to assess models on specific tasks, domains, or ethical considerations.


# 1. Installation Instructions

`python 3.0`

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

- Usage to run app:

`streamlit run app.py`

- Usage to run pipeline:
`main.py`

# 2. Configuration Details

Explain the structure and purpose of the `configs.yaml` file in more detail, including how users can customize it for their specific needs.


# Files

- `main.py`: this file serves as the core script for running evaluations on language models. It orchestrates the entire process from loading configurations to executing tasks and saving results.

- `configs.yaml`: this `YAML` file contains configuration settings for the evaluation process. It specifies:

- `app.py`: this file is a Streamlit application that provides a user interface for running model evaluations interactively. The app is designed to make the evaluation process more accessible and user-friendly, allowing for real-time interaction and visualization of results.

- `model_handler/evaluators.py`: this module likely contains the run_evaluation function, which is responsible for evaluating the model's responses. It uses a high-performing language model to compare the test model's output against expected responses, assigning scores and providing feedback.

- `task_handler/summarization.py`: this module contains the `run_summarization_task` function, which executes the summarization task. It processes the input data, runs the model, and returns the model's output for evaluation.

- `prompt_library/evaluator_prompt.yaml`: this file contains the `system_prompt` and `user_prompt`. 


## configs.yaml

- evaluation_tasks: Lists tasks with their dataset files and parameters. In particular, the name of the task and the associated yaml file with the examples to assess the model. The path to the YAML file (`custom_tasks/summarization_ecommerce_tests.yaml`) that contains the dataset and parameters for the summarization evaluation, focusing on ecommerce-related tests.

- candidate_model: Defines the model to be evaluated, including its module, class, and parameters. The provided configuration file defines parameters for using a candidate model in the `langchain_community.llms` module, specifically the `Ollama` class. The model used is `llama3.2:3b-instruct-fp16`, which is likely a 3-billion-parameter instruction-tuned version of the Llama model using half-precision (fp16) for efficiency. The `temperature` parameter is set to 0, meaning the model will produce deterministic outputs, and `num_predict` is set to 600, likely indicating the maximum token length for predictions. This setup is optimized for precise and controlled text generation.

- evaluator: Configures the evaluator model, including API key source, model parameters, and prompts. This section of the config file defines the settings for an evaluator named `chatgpt_evaluator`. It specifies that the API key is sourced from the environment (`env`) and that the GPT-4 model is used with a `temperature` of 0, ensuring deterministic outputs. The evaluator uses a set of prompts stored in the `prompt_library/evaluator_prompts.yaml` file and applies the `NumericalScorer` to score the outputs. This setup likely facilitates structured evaluation and scoring of responses generated by GPT-4 based on predefined prompts.

## How to use the webapp

This web application is designed to evaluate the performance of a model in generating concise product descriptions from technical specifications. 

Here's a breakdown of how it works based on the image:

![Alt text](readme/llmevalforge_tool.png)

<details>
  <summary>Click to see more</summary>

### Configuration Section (left panel)

- `Upload config YAML file`: This allows you to upload a **configuration file** (in YAML format) that contains the parameters and settings for the model you want to evaluate.
In the image, the `configs.yaml` file has already been loaded successfully.

- **Student Model**: The selected model for evaluation is `llama3.2:3b-instruct-fp16`, which indicates that the model is likely a version of the LLaMA language model. You can select the model to be evaluated from this dropdown menu.

- **Select task file**: This dropdown allows you to select the type of task the model will perform. In this case, "summarization" has been selected, indicating that the model will be evaluated on its ability to summarize or condense information. This section offers different predefined test cases (Case 1 to Case 5) to evaluate the model. The user can select a case to test the model's capabilities on that specific example. In this image, "Case 1" is selected.

Another option is to use "random".


### Candidate Model Inference (right panel)

- `System Prompt`: this is the prompt given to the candidate model to guide its behavior. Here, the model is instructed to act as a product description expert, generating clear and customer-friendly product descriptions based on the specifications provided.

- `Instruction`: this specifies the task the model needs to perform. In this example, the instruction is to generate a concise product description for a 65-inch 4K Ultra HD TV with specific features like HDR10+, Dolby Vision, Alexa, HDMI ports, and Energy Star certification.

- `Run Candidate Model`: click this button to run the candidate model on the selected task and generates output based on the provided instruction `model_output`, and also show a text box for the `expected Output`.

- `expected output`: this field shows the ideal output the candidate model should generate. 

### Output evaluation

- `Run Evaluator` Button: click the the button to evaluate the quality of the generated output based on the expected output or specific evaluation metrics. This will show the score and also feedback of the model evaluator.

## Evaluation Tests

### 1. Writing an evaluation task

Let's use the example of summarization capability as an example.

```
- case_id: 001
  category: Summarization
  sub_category: Product Information Understanding and Generation
  system_prompt: >
    You are a product description expert helping to generate concise, customer-friendly product descriptions in standard paragraph form based on given technical specifications. 
    Ensure that the product description is clear, highlights key features, and is suitable for e-commerce platforms.
  instruction: >
    Generate a concise product description in paragraph format for the following product specifications: 
    '4K Ultra HD 65-inch TV, HDR10+, Dolby Vision, Smart TV with built-in Alexa, 3 HDMI ports, Wi-Fi enabled, Energy Star certified.'
  expected_response: >
    Experience stunning picture quality with this 65-inch 4K Ultra HD Smart TV, featuring HDR10+ and Dolby Vision for vibrant, lifelike visuals. 
    With built-in Alexa, enjoy hands-free control, and easily connect devices through 3 HDMI ports. Energy Star certified for energy efficiency."
  potential_challenges: null
  difficulty_level: easy
```

- `case_id`: A unique identifier for the test case. This helps track and organize different test cases within the evaluation.

- `category`: The general task category being tested, here it is “Summarization”, indicating that the test is related to summarizing information.

- `sub_category`: A more specific classification within the category, which in this case is "Product Information Understanding and Generation," focusing on summarizing product details.

- `system_prompt`: The initial setup or role assigned to the candidate model, giving context for the task (e.g., generating product descriptions).

- `instruction`: A specific task for the candidate model, detailing what needs to be done based on provided inputs (e.g., creating a description from technical specs).

- `expected_response`: A sample ideal response that the candidate model should generate, giving evaluators a reference for correct output.

- `potential_challenges`: Identifies potential difficulties or common errors the candidate model might face, though it's null here.

- `difficulty_level`: Describes the expected difficulty level of the task, useful for designing a well-rounded evaluation set. The value can be "easy", "medium", "hard".
