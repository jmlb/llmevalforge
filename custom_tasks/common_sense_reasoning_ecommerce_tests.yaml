# The Abstraction and Generalization test is designed to evaluate a language model's ability to understand abstract concepts and apply them to new, unfamiliar scenarios. 
# Here's a detailed explanation of what this test is about:
# Purpose:
# 1. The test aims to assess whether the AI can:
# 2. Grasp abstract concepts from specific examples
# 3. Extract general principles from particular instances
# 4. Apply learned concepts to novel situations
# 5. Demonstrate flexible thinking and problem-solving
#
# Structure:
# The test typically consists of two main parts:
# a) Concept Introduction: A specific scenario or example that illustrates an abstract concept.
# b) Generalization Prompt: A new, unfamiliar scenario where the AI needs to apply the concept.
#
# Key Aspects:
# Conceptual Understanding: The AI must understand the underlying principle or concept, not just memorize specific details.
# Transfer Learning: The ability to take knowledge from one context and apply it appropriately in a different context.
# Creative Application: Often, the new scenario requires some creative thinking to see how the concept applies.
# 
# In essence, the Abstraction and Generalization test goes beyond simple knowledge retrieval or pattern recognition. It assesses the AI's capacity for higher-order thinking, which is crucial # for tasks that require true understanding and adaptability. This type of capability is particularly valuable in real-world applications where AI systems need to handle new, unpredictable  # situations or generate novel solutions to complex problems.

  instruction: I'm looking for something to keep me warm when it's chilly outside, but I don't want anything too bulky.
  expected_response_short: >
    Based on your request, I recommend a lightweight yet warm jacket, such as a down or fleece jacket. These types of jackets provide insulation without the bulk, making them ideal 
    for staying warm in cooler weather while maintaining a sleek and comfortable fit.
  expected_response_long: >
    It sounds like you're looking for an outerwear option that balances warmth and a slim profile. A lightweight down jacket or fleece jacket could be a great choice for you. 
    These materials are known for providing excellent insulation while being lightweight and not overly bulky. Down jackets use natural or synthetic down to trap heat efficiently, 
    and fleece jackets offer softness and warmth without adding too much weight. Additionally, you could consider layering with a thermal shirt or sweater underneath, which adds 
    warmth without the need for a heavier jacket. Some options include packable down jackets, which can be easily stored when not needed, and softshell jackets that are both 
    weather-resistant and comfortable. Would you like to see some specific recommendations?

  instruction: I need something for my home office to help with back pain.
  expected_response_short: >
    I recommend an ergonomic office chair with lumbar support. These chairs are designed to maintain proper posture and reduce strain on your back during long periods of sitting.
  expected_response_long: >
    For back pain relief in your home office, an ergonomic office chair with lumbar support would be ideal. These chairs are specifically designed to support the natural curve 
    of your spine and promote better posture, reducing discomfort during long work sessions. You might want to look for features like adjustable seat height, recline, 
    and armrests to further customize the chair to your body. Memory foam seat cushions or mesh backrests can also enhance comfort. In addition, consider adding a footrest or a 
    seat cushion to further alleviate strain. Would you like some specific chair models or accessories for this purpose?

    For a wedding where you want to look nice without being too formal, a semi-formal or cocktail dress would be perfect.
    These dresses offer a refined look but don't have the level of formality required for black-tie events. 
    You can choose from options like knee-length or midi dresses, or even a tailored jumpsuit, which offers a stylish yet understated appearance. 
    Materials like chiffon, silk, or crepe are elegant without being overly extravagant. Accessorizing with simple jewelry and a chic clutch will complete the look.

  instruction: I need a new device for watching movies, but I don't need anything too high-end.
  expected_response_short: >
    I recommend a mid-range tablet or streaming device. These options are affordable, and great for watching movies without requiring the latest high-end features.
  expected_response_long: >
    For an affordable device that's great for watching movies, you might consider a mid-range tablet or a dedicated streaming device.
    Tablets like the iPad or Samsung Galaxy Tab in their standard versions offer a large enough screen and good display quality for watching movies, without the high cost of premium models.
    Alternatively, streaming devices like the Amazon Fire Stick or Roku are excellent for turning your existing TV into a smart one, allowing easy access to popular streaming services.
    Both options give you a great viewing experience without needing the latest or most expensive features. Would you like me to show you some models within your budget?
