# These examples can help evaluate how well the model follows                #  
# instructions in an e-commerce context, covering a variety of               # 
# difficulties and scenarios commonly encountered in this domain.            # 
# in this use case, we are using the model to answer a query from            #  
# customers based on set policies                                            # 
#                                                                            #  
# Instruction-following task for the LLM requires:                           # 
#   - Clear Instructions: The system prompt provides explicit rules          # 
#   about refund policies based on product type, time limits, method         # 
#   of payment, and product condition.                                       # 
#   - Interpretation of User Input: The prompt ("Hi, I bought a              #            
#   blender...") introduces a real-world scenario where the user             # 
#   is seeking a refund based on their experience with an electronic         # 
#   item (the blender). The LLM needs to parse the prompt to extract         # 
#   relevant details, such as the product type, time of purchase,            # 
#   usage, and payment method.                                               # 
#   - Application of Policies: The LLM must apply the specific refund        # 
#   protocol (electronics: within 30 days, unused, and paid via credit       # 
#   card) to evaluate the eligibility for a refund. It follows the           # 
#   instructions provided by the system prompt (refund rules) to             # 
#   determine the correct response.                                          # 
#   - Reasoning and Response Generation: Based on the protocol, the          # 
#   LLM concludes that the item doesn’t qualify for a full refund            # 
#   since it was used. It offers an alternative (store credit or             # 
#   exchange) while explaining the ineligibility based on the usage          # 
#   condition. Since the model follows the provided refund rules and         # 
#   applies them to the specific user scenario, it is performing an          # 
#   instruction-following task.                                              #

    Hi, I bought a laptop from your store a month ago, and it stopped working. I don't 
    have the box anymore, but I have the receipt. 
    I paid cash, so can I get a refund for the laptop?
  expected_response: >
    Thank you for contacting us. As per our policy, electronics must be returned within 
    30 days with a valid receipt for a refund.
    However, we do require the product to be in its original packaging for the refund 
    to be processed. 
    Since the laptop is no longer in the original packaging, we regret to inform you 
    that we cannot process a cash refund. 
    If you would like, we can offer you in-store credit for future purchases.
  potential_challenges: >
    - Contextual Understanding: The LLM needs to correctly interpret the system prompt, 
    which outlines specific refund policies, and apply these policies accurately to the 
    user's situation. Understanding both the timeline (30-day return window) and the 
    packaging condition (original packaging required) is crucial for generating the 
    correct response.
    - Policy Application: The model needs to apply the rules in the system prompt to 
    the user's query (i.e., the laptop purchase being over 30 days and no original 
    packaging). This involves reasoning based on conditional requirements (receipt is 
    provided, but the packaging is missing).
    - Language Generation: The model must generate a polite, professional response that 
    communicates the reason for the denial clearly while offering an alternative 
    (in-store credit).
    - Instruction Following: The model has to balance between strictly following the 
    rules and managing customer relations by offering alternatives, which is a nuanced 
    task.

    I purchased a shirt last month, but it doesn't fit me well. I have the receipt, but I used a 
    gift card to pay for it. Can I return it and get a refund in cash?
  expected_response >
    Thank you for reaching out, and I'm sorry to hear about the issues you're facing. Let me 
    address each of your concerns:
    1. **Laptop Refund**: Since the laptop is defective, you are eligible for a full refund, even 
    though it's been 40 days. As per our policy, refunds are issued to the original payment methods. 
    This means:
      - The portion paid with store credit will be refunded as store credit.
      - The portion paid with the gift card will be refunded back to the gift card.
      - The portion paid with your credit card will be refunded to the card, and it may take 3-5 
      business days to reflect.
    2. **Jeans Exchange**: You can exchange the jeans for a smaller size as long as they're still 
    in their original condition. If the new pair of jeans is of lesser value, the difference will 
    be refunded to your original payment method, following the same breakdown as mentioned above. 
    If the new pair is of greater value, you will need to pay the price difference.
    3. **Loyalty Points**: You should have earned 400 loyalty points for the purchase, and I 
    apologize for the confusion. It's possible that the points haven't been credited due to an 
    issue with our system. I will escalate this to our support team to ensure the points are 
    credited to your account.
    4. **Shipping Costs**: You won't need to pay for shipping for the laptop return since it's 
    defective. However, for the jeans exchange, you will need to cover the shipping costs. If you 
    need expedited shipping for the replacement jeans, there will be an additional $10 fee.

    Please let me know if you'd like assistance with arranging the returns and exchanges, or if you 
    have any further questions.

  instruction: >
    I purchased a set of headphones as a gift for my brother last month, but he didn't like them. 
    I paid with a credit card during the Black Friday sale, and now I want to return them. However, 
    I opened the packaging to check if the headphones worked, but they are unused. 
    Additionally, I no longer have the original receipt. I live in Canada, and I don't want store 
    credit. Can you issue the refund back to my credit card?
  expected_response: >
    Thank you for reaching out. I understand that you would like to return the headphones.
    Unfortunately, as the purchase was made during our Black Friday sale, our policy allows refunds 
    only in the form of store credit for such holiday purchases. Since the product is opened but 
    unused, you would still be eligible for a refund if it was not a 'final sale' item, even without 
    the receipt, provided we can confirm your purchase in our system. However, as you're located in 
    Canada, the refund will incur a 10% restocking fee.
    Please note that we cannot issue a refund back to your credit card in this case, but the store 
    credit will reflect the remaining value after the restocking fee. If you need further assistance, 
    please let us know, and we'd be happy to help.
  potential_challenges: >
    - Complex Refund Policy Application: The case involves several overlapping rules, including 
    special     sales terms (Black Friday), international restocking fees, and the customer's 
    refusal of store credit.
    - Missing Information: The user doesn't have the original receipt, requiring the model to handle 
    an edge case by proposing a possible workaround (finding the transaction in the system).
    - Multiple Policy Violations and Exceptions: The headphones were purchased on sale, the packaging 
    was opened, and the return is international—all of which add complexity and involve multiple 
    policy elements.
    - Emotional Handling: The user is likely dissatisfied with the idea of store credit, so the 
    response must balance clarity of policy with a tone that tries to retain customer satisfaction.
    - Specificity of Action: The model must understand the multiple restrictions (e.g., store 
    credit-only refunds for Black Friday purchases) and communicate them in a way that doesn't 
    frustrate the customer further.

  instruction: >
    I bought a blender and a set of kitchen knives three weeks ago. The blender doesn't work 
    properly—it only blends on one speed and makes a strange noise. The knives are fine, but I didn't 
    end up using them. I paid for the blender using a combination of a gift card and my credit card, 
    and the knives with cash.
    I also ordered some fresh produce in the same purchase, which arrived damaged, and I didn't bother 
    requesting a refund at the time because I thought it was just a one-time issue. 
    Can I get a refund for the blender and the produce? Also, if I return the knives, can I get a 
    refund for them in cash?
  expected_response: >
    Thank you for contacting us. Let's go through your situation step by step.
    1. **Blender**: Since the blender is defective, you are eligible for a partial refund based on 
    the defect's severity, as per our policy. We would need more information to assess the level of 
    the defect. The refund will be issued proportionally to the payment methods you used—part will 
    be refunded to your gift card and part to your credit card.
    2. **Produce**: Unfortunately, per our policy, we cannot issue a refund for perishable products 
    such as fresh produce, even if they were damaged upon arrival.
    3. **Knives**: Since the knives are unused and still in their original packaging, you are eligible 
    for a refund within the 30-day window. However, because they were paid for in cash, the refund will 
    be issued in cash.
    Please let us know if you'd like to proceed with the refund for the blender and knives, and if you 
    need help assessing the blender's defect for the partial refund.
  potential_challenges: >
    Multiple Products with Different Policies: The user is asking about a refund for three different 
    types of items (electronics, perishable goods, and unused non-perishable goods), all of which 
    fall under distinct refund policies.
    Partial Refunds: The defective blender introduces the complexity of a partial refund based on the 
    defect's severity.
    Proportional Refund Calculation: The user used multiple payment methods (gift card and credit 
    card), requiring the model to understand how to split the refund proportionally.
    Non-Refundable Item: The user mentions damaged produce, but the model needs to recognize that 
    perishables are non-refundable based on policy.
    Mixed Payment Methods: Handling different payment methods (cash, gift card, and credit card) 
    with different refund protocols adds complexity.
    Polite and Clear Response: The response needs to be respectful, polite, and thorough in 
    explaining the reasoning behind each refund decision.
