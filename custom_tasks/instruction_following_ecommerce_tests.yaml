# These examples can help you evaluate how well the model follows instructions in an e-commerce context, covering a variety of 
# difficulties and scenarios commonly encountered in this domain.
# Instruction-following task for the LLM requires:
#   - Clear Instructions: The system prompt provides explicit rules about refund policies based on product type, time limits, method of payment, and product condition.
#   - Interpretation of User Input: The prompt ("Hi, I bought a blender...") introduces a real-world scenario where the user is seeking a refund based on their experience 
#     with an electronic item (the blender). The LLM needs to parse the prompt to extract relevant details, such as the product type, time of purchase, usage, and payment method.
#   - Application of Policies: The LLM must apply the specific refund protocol (electronics: within 30 days, unused, and paid via credit card) to evaluate the eligibility for a refund. 
#     It follows the instructions provided by the system prompt (refund rules) to determine the correct response.
#   - Reasoning and Response Generation: Based on the protocol, the LLM concludes that the item doesn’t qualify for a full refund since it was used. It offers an alternative 
#     (store credit or exchange) while explaining the ineligibility based on the usage condition.
# Since the model follows the provided refund rules and applies them to the specific user scenario, it is performing an instruction-following task.

    Hi, I bought a laptop from your store a month ago, and it stopped working. I don't have the box anymore, but I have the receipt.

    I purchased a shirt last month, but it doesn't fit me well. I have the receipt, but I used a gift card to pay for it. Can I return it and get a refund in cash?
  expected_response_short: >
    Thank you for reaching out. As per our policy, clothing can be refunded within 60 days if you have the receipt. 
    However, since the payment was made with a gift card, the refund would be issued back to the gift card and not in cash.

    Thank you for contacting us. We understand that the shirt you purchased last month doesn't fit well. 
    Since our policy allows clothing refunds within 60 days with a valid receipt, you are eligible for a return. 
    However, because the item was paid for with a gift card, the refund can only be processed back to the original gift card, in line with our refund policy. 
    Unfortunately, we cannot issue refunds in cash for purchases made with gift cards. Please bring the shirt and receipt to any of our stores, and we'd be happy to process the refund for you.
