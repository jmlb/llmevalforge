# This task measures the inference speed of a language model by varying the length of generated  #
# output while keeping the complexity of the input relatively simple. The goal is to assess how  #
# quickly the model can generate responses of different lengths and to establish a correlation   #
# between response length and latency.                                                           #

    Hello, I'm interested in buying a new laptop for both work and gaming. I need something with at least 16GB of RAM, a dedicated graphics card, and a fast processor. 
    My budget is around $1500. I've been looking at the TechPro GamerWork 5000 and the DataFlux Extreme, but I'm not sure which one would be better for my needs. 
    The TechPro has a slightly better graphics card, but the DataFlux has more storage. 
    I also want to make sure that whichever laptop I choose has good cooling systems as I plan to use it for long gaming sessions. 
    Do you have any recommendations between these two models, or perhaps a different laptop that would suit my needs? Also, do you offer any extended warranty options for gaming laptops?
