  name: E-commerce Common Sense Reasoning Dataset
  version: "1.0"
  description: |
    This task is categorized as a common sense reasoning task task where the LLM must answer from a customer query that is vague and ambiguous 
    Thetask is designed to evaluate a language model's ability to understand abstract concepts and apply them to new, 
    unfamiliar scenarios.
    
    Here's a detailed explanation of what this test is about:
    Purpose:
      1. The test aims to assess whether the AI can:
      2. Grasp abstract concepts from specific examples
      3. Extract general principles from particular instances
      4. Apply learned concepts to novel situations
      5. Demonstrate flexible thinking and problem-solving

    Key Aspects: 
      - Conceptual Understanding: The AI must understand the underlying principle or concept, not just 
    memorize specific details.
      - Transfer Learning: The ability to take knowledge from one context and apply it appropriately in a
    different context.
      - Creative Application: Often, the new scenario requires some creative thinking to see how the
    concept applies.

    In essence, the Abstraction and Generalization test goes beyond simple knowledge retrieval or
    pattern recognition. It assesses the AI's capacity for higher-order thinking, which is crucial
    for tasks that require true understanding and adaptability. This type of capability is
    particularly valuable in real-world applications where AI systems need to handle new,
    unpredictable situations or generate novel solutions to complex problems.

test_cases:
  - case_id: 1
    category: common_sense_reasoning
    sub_category: 
      - search_systems
      - recommendation_systems
    system_prompt: |
      You are an intelligent assistant for an e-commerce website, helping users find products they are interested in.
    instruction: |
      I'm looking for something to keep me warm when it's chilly outside, but I don't want anything too bulky.
    expected_response: |
      Based on your request, I recommend a lightweight yet warm jacket, such as a down or fleece jacket. 
      These types of jackets provide insulation without the bulk, making them ideal 
      for staying warm in cooler weather while maintaining a sleek and comfortable fit.
    challenges: |
      - Interpreting the vague requirement of "keeping warm when it's chilly" and translating it into specific product attributes (e.g., insulation and weight).
      - Understanding the implied preference for something "not bulky" and recommending appropriate products like down or fleece jackets.
      - Avoiding overly generic responses while providing a clear and specific recommendation.

    system_prompt: |
      You are an intelligent assistant for an e-commerce website, helping users find products based on vague descriptions.
    instruction: I need something for my home office to help with back pain.
    expected_response: |
      I recommend an ergonomic office chair with lumbar support. These chairs are designed to maintain 
      proper posture and reduce strain on your back during long periods of sitting.
    challenges: |
      - Inferring that "help with back pain" requires ergonomic features without explicit mention of posture support.
      - Identifying suitable categories of products (e.g., chairs with lumbar support) from the vague context.
      - Balancing specificity with conciseness to ensure the recommendation is actionable and relevant.

    system_prompt: |
      You are an intelligent assistant for an online fashion store, helping users find clothing items based on unclear requests.
    instruction: I'm looking for something nice to wear to a wedding, but it shouldn't be too fancy.
    expected_response: |
      I recommend a semi-formal or cocktail dress. These options strike the right balance between looking 
      elegant and not being overly fancy, making them appropriate for most weddings.
    challenges: |
      - Understanding the social and cultural nuances of wedding attire and aligning the recommendation with "semi-formal" or "cocktail" styles.
      - Avoiding overly broad or inappropriate suggestions that may not fit the context of a wedding.
      - Providing a clear recommendation that balances the "nice" and "not too fancy" requirements.

      You are an intelligent assistant for a tech e-commerce platform, helping users find electronic products.
    instruction: I need a new device for watching movies, but I don't need anything too high-end.
    expected_response: |
      I recommend a mid-range tablet or streaming device. These options are affordable, and great for watching 
      movies without requiring the latest high-end features.
    challenges: |
      - Inferring that the user prioritizes affordability and functionality over premium features.
      - Recommending mid-range products that strike the balance between cost and usability for movie streaming.
      - Avoiding recommendations that are either too generic or too specific, which could misalign with the user's needs.

    system_prompt: |
      You are an intelligent assistant for an e-commerce website specializing in electronics, tasked with helping users who provide unclear or ambiguous product requests.
    instruction: |
      I need something that helps me stay productive when I'm traveling, but it shouldn't be too big or heavy. I also need it for presentations and maybe some light editing.
    expected_response: |
      I recommend a lightweight 2-in-1 laptop or tablet with a detachable keyboard.
      These devices offer portability, flexibility for giving presentations, and enough power for light editing 
      tasks while keeping the weight and size manageable.
    challenges: |
      - Parsing the multifaceted requirements: portability, productivity, presentation capabilities, and light editing.
      - Recommending versatile devices like 2-in-1 laptops or tablets while ensuring they meet all stated criteria.
      - Balancing the recommendation between performance (for presentations and editing) and portability (weight and size).
      - Handling the ambiguity in the user's description and aligning the recommendation with their implied needs.
